After making a bold career switch, I've been diving deep into the world of coding for the past seven months. Although I do have a degree in Computer Science, I've found that most of my recent learning has been through my own self-guided exploration. 

I'm incredibly passionate about constantly expanding my knowledge and skills, and I'm always on the lookout for exciting new opportunities to grow. Let's connect and embark on this coding adventure together! ðŸš€
